# Snake_Case_Sanitizer
This is a simple CLI tool that will take in a given directory and recursively comb through it,
renaming all files and folders to follow `snake_case` conventions.

The purpose of this project is to get more familiar with the Go language, and to leverage 
its concurrency features.

> Yes, the irony of the kebab-case repository name is not lost on me.
